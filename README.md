## 🚀 Current Role
Senior Security Engineer at Teya (ignore the senior - it's a title of convenience)
- 🏢 Architecting secure financial services infrastructure for SMBs
- 🛡️ Managing PCI-DSS compliance implementation and maintenance
- 🔒 Developing robust security engineering solutions
- 📊 Leading security metrics and monitoring initiatives
- 🧭 Acting lead for security engineering, reporting to the CISO as acting head/director

## 👀 Professional Focus & Expertise
```yaml
Security Domains:
  - Financial Services Security
  - PCI-DSS Compliance
  - Cloud Security Architecture
  - Security Engineering
  - FinTech Infrastructure Protection

Tech Stack:
  Cloud Platforms:
    - Major cloud providers
  Security Tools:
    - Secrets management
    - Edge security/CDN
    - Endpoint protection
  Infrastructure:
    - Infrastructure as code
    - Containers
    - Orchestration
  Monitoring:
    - SIEM platforms
    - Metrics and observability
```

## 🌱 Current Learning Goals
1. Advancing information safety practices that make security a byproduct
2. Designing resilient, humane systems with safe defaults and soft landings
3. Leaning into AI/ML usage and understanding so I'm not left behind as adversaries adopt it
4. Exploring how safety-focused engineering reduces security risk

## 🧠 Modeling & Reasoning
- Semantic and ontological modeling, engineering, and reasoning
- Ontological requirements engineering with AI-assisted formal proofs (e.g., Coq, EYE), written, tested, and attested
- Advanced algebra for detection logic
- Learning formal provers and Rete-based reasoning systems

## 🧰 Engineering Approach
- Polyglot programming with AI-assisted code generation and validation, grounded in review, tests, and QA

## 📚 Featured Projects & Contributions

### 🛡️ Security Automation Framework
- Developed comprehensive security automation using IaC
- Tech: Infrastructure as code, cloud platforms, programming

### 🔍 Enhanced Detection Engineering
- Created custom threat detection rules
- Tech: SIEM platforms, detection logic, analytics
- Implementing formalized bespoke semantic detection engineering since 2013
- Can build a minimal SIEM on the back of a cigarette packet (for a single event)
- Believe a SIEM should be an alarm receiving center focused on actionable alerts, with observability retaining the data lake
- Best threat intelligence data is your own: the bare-face indicators in your logs. Collect and act on them; external TIP is a second opinion, not an authority.

### 🔐 PCI-DSS Compliance Toolkit
- Built automated compliance checking tools
- Streamlined audit preparations
